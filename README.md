# Swapi API

## Overview
**Author:** Karan Sharma

Swapi API is a .NET web API designed to facilitate the search for Star Wars films based on various criteria, including title, characters, director, producer, planets, starships, vehicles, and species. The API harnesses the power of the [Star Wars API (SWAPI)](https://swapi.dev/) to retrieve detailed film information.
